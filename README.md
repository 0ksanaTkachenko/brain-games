### Hexlet tests and linter status:

<!-- The project consists of five console games:

brain-even - parity of a number
brain-calc - mathematical operations between numbers
brain-gcd - greatest common divisor of two numbers
brain-progression - missing number in an arithmetic progression
brain-prime - prime number or not
All games are launched in the terminal by their names. Before starting the games, you need to install them once by running the command "make install" in the terminal, after which you can enter the name of the game in the terminal and start playing.

To see an example of installation and the gameplay process, follow the links in the file. -->
